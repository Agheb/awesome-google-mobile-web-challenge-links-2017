### .this keyword:

> With regular functions, the value of **'.this'** is set based on how the function is called.
> With arrow functions, the value of **'.this'** is based on the function's surrounding context.
> In other words, the value of **'.this'** inside an arrow function is the same as the value of **'.this'** outside the function.


### Classes

> In ES6 classes are just a mirage and hide the fact that prototypal inheritance
> is actually going on under the hood, let's quickly look at how to create a "class" with ES5 code:


### Super: Keyword

> super must be called before **'.this'**
> In a subclass constructor function, before **'.this'** can be used, a call to the super class must be made.
