> IndexedDB is an API to store data (structured) uncluding files and [blobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object).
> The API allows you to create indexes to perform efficient searches of the stored data.
> Web Storage allows to store small amounts of data but is useless for larger amounts of data.
> IndexedDB provides a solution to this problem.
