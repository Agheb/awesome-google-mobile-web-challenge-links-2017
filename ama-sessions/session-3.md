**Mentors**: Anais, Andy, Paul, Marat

#### Do you follow also our response in Quizzes? Are they part of the valuation?
If you don't get all answers correctly on the first try that's perfectly normal and okay! We evaluate the fact that you have attempted all the quizzes.

#### Are one-on-one interactions with our classmates on slack relevant when measuring our activity over here?
Any messages that you send in a private message to other users on slack will not be tracked by Udacity. These messages are private between the people involved in the conversations. Our community managers will be monitoring the public channels for activity and keeping an eye out for students that are helpful to others and provide value in the scholarship community. We know that helping each other out leads to a better learning experience for everyone which is why we encourage these interaction!
(It's also worth noting here that we ask all of our students to be respectful to each other both in public channels and also in private messages. *If anyone experiences any hostility from other students please report it to an admin immediately.*)

#### If i have no degree regarding computer science, would that course help me find a job as an android developer?
There isn't any career support in the first phase of the scholarship - however, for all the students who get selected for the second round, they will have access to the career support provided inside of the Nanodegree. It is important to note, however, that even if you successfully finish Android Basics nanodegree, you will still have a lot to learn! We estimate that students are fully-job ready after completing the intermediate program, Android Developer. That said, students from the previous scholarship managed to get internships and even jobs after doing only Android Basics Nanodegree last year, so everything is possible.

#### What is the feasible shortest time to complete the Android Basics course? I am trying to figure out how much time should I spend on Forums/Slack and how much on the actual course.
Full thread here: https://andbasics-challenge.slack.com/archives/C7UNWNF8B/p1510843094000168)

We have allowed 3 months for this first part of the challenge to ensure that everyone has enough time to complete the content regardless of experience or other life commitments. As for spending time in Slack, we emphasise the community aspects because it enhances the learning experience. So please just be helpful to other students. There's no need to keep track of the time you spend here for the sake of spending time here.

#### When the challenge is over, will this Slack workspace stay around? Will it be the same one for people selected for Nanodegree? And later for the Intermediate course?
You will have access to these slack channels and forums for a month after the 3-month phase 1 is over. Please bear in mind that though you will have access, these platforms won't be moderated. For phase 2 new channels will be created.

#### Our website says "_20,000 seats_ for phase 1 then _"2,000 scholarships"_ for phase two. Assuming we're approx. 10,000* doing this challenge, how many people will get selected for the Nanodegree?
#### - Do you apply a 10% ratio? (i.e. 2,000 ppl if we're 20,000; 1,000 ppl if we're 10,000, etc.)
#### - Will 2,000 people be selected no matter how many we are? (i.e.2,000 ppl even if we're <5,000 participating in this challenge)
#### Can you please clarify? I had different and contradictory bits of information
We've accepted approx 10-15k students for this track. That said, the number of students who have been enrolled don't affect the number of scholarships that will be awarded at the end of the first phase. There will still be 2,000 students who will be accepted into the Nanodegree program.

#### How many people actually did *not* get to the scholarship (this first stage)?
We received 150,000 applications for the scholarships. This means there were approx 90k people that we were unfortunately not able to grant the scholarship to. This is why we hope you'll all make the most of the opportunity.

#### Here is my first question: are one-on-one interactions with out classmates on slack be relevant when measuring our activity over here?
Thanks for the question! We cannot moderate or measure anything that happens in one-one conversations or direct messages between students on this Slack channel. Which doesn't mean that you shouldn't write to anyone! The reason we encourage you guys to be active and part of this community is because it will help you better understand concepts, get over obstacles and generally speaking will just make you a better, more curious developer.

#### Do you have any other resources for us to do more project together once we finished the course? any additional ideas so we can practice this level of android development?
Right now the best thing you can do is to find other students here on slack to work with and start your own projects. There is a #meet_study_buddies channel which can pair you with other students or you can also try reaching out directly to other students. Working on additional projects is a great way to reinforce your learning and we definitely encourage it.

#### Will we be able to access the classroom after the course is completed? Do we have a permanent access to learning materials or will we be prevented from accessing it in time?
Your progress throughout any of Udacity's courses will be saved on your account. You may need to re-enroll into the free version of the program once the Scholarship has ended, but you won't lose anything for doing so.

#### For those who were not selected for the second phase, there is a special program type, like discount to take the next course paying to complete the nanodegree program?
Generally speaking there are a lot of special things that come with being part of the scholarship program! Last year we did offer a small discount to students who hadn't been selected so they could continue studying. I can't guarantee we'll do it again this year, but that's the idea!

#### I have a full time job + 2 kids, I'm not looking for excuses but it hard to keep up with Slack and forum. So how often is enough to participate at helping on forum and slack to have a chance to be selected for the challenge. Don’t get me wrong I’m not helping on forum just to get the scholarship, I love sharing with people it's that I’m afraid that my chances are very limited
Thanks for the question! We completely understand that everyone has other commitments and will not be able to work on this full-time - we would not expect this from any of our students. It's for this reason that we have allocated an initial 3 months for this first part of the program. It will give everyone plenty of time to work through the course content and get the most from the community aspects.

#### Hi! Quick question: I am working at the moment and attending the scholarship classes online. I am afraid I do not have much time to be on Slack. How will this affect the possibility of entering  the Nanodegree program? Thank you!
We completely understand that many of you have full-time work, school and life commitments and appreciate that this scholarship program will fit into your other responsibilities. In terms of community interaction, we encourage you to contribute when you can and works for your schedule. It's more about the quality of your contributions and engagement than quantity.  Just make sure to build in the time and hold yourself accountable to using it well.

#### What will happen if a person finished the course for 100%, but never really communicated on forums / Slack? Will this person be immediately refused or still have some chance? Will this chance depend on a q-ty of people who actually finished the lessons?
This chance will depend on the number of people who have actually finished all of the course content. Then we will be looking at forum data as the second point of selection. If a lot of people finish all the course content, then yes, someone who has never done anything on the forum or slack will be eliminated next to someone who has also completed all the course content and been more active.

#### How do I know who my personal mentor it during the course? How often may I contact him? Is there a possibility to have a video chat with him/her or can I also write to him/her? Or do I have to solve all my struggles on the forum/slack?
Personal mentorship is not one of the services offered in the scholarship challenge. The forums and slack communities are where you will receive the help you need from our mentors and also other students.

#### Do I have the right to share some of my projects outside of this community (i.e. Slack/Forum)? I'd love to have feedback from other people (i.e. other Slack channels, mom/dad and stuff)
Of course! You can share your projects wherever you like - I'm sure your Mum & Dad would be proud! We also have the hashtag #madewithudacity where there are lots of Udacity students from all over the world sharing their projects across twitter, facebook and instagram so feel free to screenshot them or post a link and post on your social channels if you like. One of my favourite books is called "So good they can't ignore you" by Cal Newport and it's sharing your work in public is one of the key pieces of advice. So share away!

#### What has more weight in measuring our activity - Slack or forum?
When the time for selection comes, we look at three main things: your course progression, then your forum activity, then your Slack activity. Your forum activity does carry more weight than Slack, but they're both important when it comes to measuring your involvement.

#### Regarding the official country channels on slack. You said that quality is more relevant than quantity, but is the quality of our interactions measured despite of the fact that we communicate in our native language on those channels?
Our community managers are keeping an eye out for people who are being helpful to other students - Even if it's not in English it's possible to identify those that are providing value for the benefit of the community. We have eyes and ear everywhere.

#### Does it mean that if I am not talking in Slack or not posting much on forum I will get less chance to continue course?
The most important thing is that you finish the course before the deadline in February. We have a plethora of metrics to help us in understanding your activity and how much effort you've put into the program. That said, being active on Slack and spending time on the forum will strengthen your application for the phase two selection process.

#### Are you paying attention on our submitted project only on the code itself or how the application looks like also matters?
In this phase 1 of the scholarship we do not provide you with formal reviews of your code - instead we would like you to get used to posting your projects in the forum and get feedback. What we want to see is that you try and improve and iterate on your projects, rather than trying to get it perfectly on the first try. In real life, if you're a developer, that's how you'll be working so it's important that you take the good habits now.

#### Hello @anais.udacity , I would like to ask when I end the lesson 13. Is there a place in Udacity where I could practice programming? Than you
We know from experience that teaching others is a great way of solidifying your learning; this is why we try to encourage as much interaction between all the scholarship participants as possible. One of Udacity’s values is BetterTogether and this applies to our community of students as well as internally. Don't forget that this is also a crucial part of your eligibility to get into the second phase of the program. Help each other out - you’ll go further together!
Other than that, in order to practice and further your skills towards the Nanodegree, I encourage you to check out some of Udacity’s free courses, which you can find through our course catalog here: https://www.udacity.com/courses/all

#### I just joined slack channel today because I entered a wrong channel by mistake. Will this affect on choosing me for phrase 2 of this course?
We're only on week two of the program and so there's still plenty of time to be active on Slack. Your forum activity and course progress are still tracked from the beginning and carry more weight than your Slack involvement. That said, I recommend being active on the channel when you can.

#### Do you have any suggestions for good books to read for complete beginners to coding. I'm looking for something that gives a good overview of everything to do with coding, not just android and java. I'd like to understand what the other languages are, what they are used for, the key differences/pros/cons etc. The idea is to understand where java fits into the overall coding world
- your fellow students will probably have lots of suggestions here. For me personally, I would suggest that you read books that cover topics like learning how to learn and how to think about your career.
Two I recommend are:
- So good they can't ignore you by Cal Newport
- The startup of you by Reid Hoffman
And a book that everyone should read is How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. All cover great life skills that you will benefit from

#### Hi everyone. I usually get a kick of helping people online. Like I said before, I want to be the one helping other in stackoverflow someday (ahah) for this, I usually take my time taking the lessons and build extra projects. My question is, from what I saw there are 3 dedicated Android/mobile courses in udacity ? (basics, developer and mobile ) Is this correct? Are the 3 complementary?
Sort of - those are 3 different Nanodegree programs. The Android Basics Nanodegree comes before the Android Developer Nanodegree (which is intermediate level) so it's quite common that students will do both. And our Mobile Web Specialist nanodegree
program is a new one that is complimentary, but requires Front End skills. I hope this helps.

#### I've noticed that there is many people with former programming experience, which means they might be more helpful on forum than people with no former programming experience, I understand that we develop once we learn but it seems that not experienced people have smaller chance to get to phase 2. Or do you consider experience level during the selection?
Activity and involvement in the forum and Slack channels take many different forms. While there may be some students who are naturally proficient at tasks, we also take into consideration your willingness to learn and to get involved with the community. Whether you're giving some feedback on their work or just being helpful anyway you can, there are many aspects that we take into consideration. Plus, making the effort to help someone out is also an excellent way to strengthen your own knowledge on an area. I personally believe that teaching is one of the best methods of learning.

#### What if someone asks a question, I start replying with a solution, but in the meantime, someone else answers before us. Will my answer to that question still be counted as a relevant and meaningful interaction?
In the forums we have lots of insights and data that we can monitor to keep track of students that are providing value. In slack the community managers are keeping an eye out for the students that are being helpful. It's definitely not as granular as someone jumping in front of you to respond on a question.

#### A number of us have completed all the lessons and are refining our projects together. Can you suggest the most relevant free Udacity courses that we can do in the meantime that will NOT be covered by phase 2 so that we can take things further but not duplicate our
Phase two will be the full Android Basics Nanodegree. All the courses covered in the Nanodegree can be found in the syllabus section here:
https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803
I would then suggest you take a look at the full course catalog at udacity.com/course/all to pick out other courses of interest to you studies?

#### Will you evaluate the quality of design / appearance of applications or it doesn't matter at all?
Design and appearance are subjective notions, and hence we cannot evaluate them. What we do evaluate is your learning process: your ability to get feedback and implement it into your work. So share your work on the forum, get feedback, improve and polish your result, post it again and so on. BetterTogether - that's the thing we like.

#### Another question I have is about forum badges. Are certain badges relevant for our activity? Eg the badges we get when we receive a number of likes for a solution we provided, and so on.
There are a lot more data points that we look at outside of badges, but yes - badges are one element that matters when evaluating your activity on the forum.

#### I have a general question about enrolling in other nano degrees. I see that they are £150 per month. Are we allowed to do them rapidly in just one month or is there a minimum number of months that we have to sign up for?
Our Nanodegree programs come in lots of different formats. Some of them are subscription based as you mention. With these, you can work through the content as fast as you like and yes, if you complete it within 1 month (tough to do I must add :laughing:) then full credit to you! However, most of our programs are now term based and students need to complete the projects following a certain schedule over a number of months.

#### For many of the quizzes you have to write in some text in order to progress and that text is retained. Will you also assess the written answers to these questions when selecting people for phase 2? I for one have some answers which could have been written in a clearer way or could be longer. I am wondering if I should go back and work on them again if they will be used as a criterion to assess me.
We measure your progression in the course, not the fact that everything you have done is perfectly correct. When it comes to the quizzes, we always evaluate the fact you have attempted them, not whether or not your answers were the best ones. As long as you show that you've tried, this is what we'll be looking at. Hope that helps

#### Hi ! It may be too much looking into the future but assuming that somebody finishes whole Nanodegree Program (so after 9 months including second phase of this challenge), is there a possibility to move directly to more advanced Android Development program? Do you plan another Google Udacity challenge or any, even paid option to move directly to this next level program? Thanks in advance for answer!;)
Our Android Developer Nanodegree program is the direct follow up to the Android Basics Nanodegree, so yes you could absolutely just continue with it. Just in general, you can pay for a nanodegree at any point, even while you are enrolled in the Scholarships program. You can take as many  as you would like at the same time even if you are enrolled in free courses.

#### The importance of contributing to Forums and Slack is well-understood for me. However, I have a doubt that if I don't have the opportunity to participate in the Forums, my chance for phase 2 will decrease, won't it? Or you may mean that if you have two students with the same progress, you will be filtering them by their contribution to the Forums. Is this right or I misunderstand something?
If there are two students who are on the same level in terms of course completion, the one with more activity in the Forum and Slack channel will have the stronger application. Because there are only 2000 spots available for the next phase, we must take many metrics into consideration for the phase two selection process.

#### I got lost a little bit between all of the course's names. Currently we are taking part in Google Developer Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics. There was also Android Developer version of the scholarship. How do they apply to Android Developer Nanodegree and Android Basics Nanodegree programs?
This is the Android Basics Track! So to be clear: each track starts with Google Developer Challenge Scholarship. That's Phase 1. Since you are in the Android Basics Track, if you get selected for Phase 2, you will get access to the full Android Basics Nanodegree. Android Developer is a completely different track that you don't have access to

#### Hello, is this the second or third session since the 6 of november. I thought it is the second , but I think that anais said that this is the third, did I miss a session?
This is the 2nd session. Anais may have made a small error if she said this was the third.

#### Is it alright if we focus on finishing the course first before being heavily active in the forums helping other people and on slack? This way, we only post if we get stuck on a problem, afterwards being able to help with the knowledge accumulated throughout the course, maybe even people on future challenge scholarships.
You have 3 months for the first phase of the program and it's entirely up to you how you use this time. Both asking questions when you're stuck and implementing the feedback, AND sharing your knowledge after you've finished the course are valuable and meaningful ways to learn and take part in the community.  If you think that the way you described is the most practical for you, go ahead! In the end we look at the quality of your interaction within the community, but it doesn't mean only being an expert. Asking for help and sharing your problems helps not only you but also others who might be in the same situation as you. _BetterTogether_

#### Is there any chance to get nanodegree program if we won’t chosen 3 months later
You can pay and enroll in any Nanodegree program at any time you like via the website. So if you don't get selected for the second phase, yes, you could still enroll in the Nanodegree and continue studying.

#### I would like to ask if there's no more important questions: what is it like for you mentors. How's your day like, what do you enjoy most?
I wouldn't call us mentors, we're the Community Managers here to make sure that Slack continues to be a fun and safe environment to learn and interact with each other. Our day revolves around you - the students and we honestly couldn't be happier with it. Being in an online environment with so many excited and motivated people from all around the world is definitely one of the best things about the job.

#### One more question about content of the course. There is assessed time for each of the Lessons. What if we are spending more time on it, e.g instead 3 hours, it's 5 hours? Does it have influence on our possible enrollment to the next stage?
The time you see attached to the lessons is just there for your own benefit so that you can have a rough estimate of how long it could take to go through the lesson. Some students work faster than others, but what matters most is completing the task. You won't be penalized in any way for taking longer than the estimated time to finish a lesson,

#### Like someone was asking it matter if we don’t have a degree in computer science but have the nanodegree from you when we will try to get a job ?
This Nanodegree is more an introductive one, that gives you the foundations to then build on those skills. That said, you could definitely start looking for internships, or entry-level positions at the end of the full Android Basics Nanodegree. This Nanodegree equips you with hands-on, practical skills that you will need to improve on and keep building everyday. Having the nanodegree certificate will be important to show to an employer and demonstrate that you have the right mindset - but what is even more important is the projects that you will be building along this program: those will go in your portfolio and will be a proof that you can do the job.
